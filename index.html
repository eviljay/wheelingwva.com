Wheeling lies near West Virginia's great coal- and natural-gas-producing region,
and these minerals furnish power for many of the city's industries. Wheeling's
most important products include aluminum, bronze, chemical products, garments,
glass, iron and steel, metal stampings, plastics, and tin plate. The city is
also a coal shipping center. Tourism is the most important industry in Wheeling,
which attracts visitors with its parks, historic sites, and local events.
&quot;Jamboree USA,&quot; a weekly country music show at Wheeling's
Capitol Music Hall, is broadcast in the United States and Canada. A Winter
Festival of Lights is held from early November to early January. Wheeling has
two modern hospitals and is a medical center for the surrounding region.<br>
Colonel Ebenezer Zane and his brothers founded Wheeling in the winter of
1769-1770. They came from the south branch of the Potomac Valley in Virginia to
settle a claim at the city's present site. Other settlers soon joined them, and
in 1774 they erected Fort Fincastle. In 1776, they changed the fort's name to
Fort Henry in honor of Patrick Henry. Wheeling was laid out in 1793,
incorporated in 1806, and first chartered as a city in 1836. The National Road,
now U.S. Highway 40, reached the Ohio River at Wheeling in 1818.<br>
During the Civil War (1861-1865), Wheeling was the headquarters of Virginians
who opposed secession from the Union. Union supporters organized the state of
West Virginia in Wheeling on June 20, 1863, and the city served as the state
capital from 1863 to 1870 and from 1875 to 1885. Wheeling has a city-manager
form of government.<br>
